 * methods to generate the loggable string. Instead, the string, if computed lazily, will be computed only when the logging level in question is actually
 * enabled in the logging configuration, without any need to test it explicitly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any implementing class <strong>must</strong> override the {@link #toString()} method. Instead of implementing this interface directly, it is recommended
 * to extend {@link AbstractLoggable}, which enforces overriding {@code toString()}.
